# Leviathan Game

This project is an Audio-only game, intended to be played with headphones and a controller.
In the 'Leviathan Game', the player becomes a castaway after their seafaring vessel is attacked by some hostile entity from the depths. Their goal is to row their rowboat towards safety - the sound of buoys - whilst avoiding the seamonster that is hunting you.   

## Description

The 'Leviathan Game' was developed as part of the 'Sound Design' course at HKU, by three students. The goal was to make a game that is completely playable and understandable by audio-cues only.
Since the game relies on hearing, headphones are strongly recommended. The gameplay mechanics in-game work best when playing using a controller, where each joystick represents an oar of the rowboat.

Be quiet when the monster draws close, but row towards the safety of the buoy when you have a chance to escape!
